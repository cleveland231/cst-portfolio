        Hello friend! My name is Cleveland Ticoalu and I am a freelance software engineer. I just graduated from Turing School of 
        Software and Design with a focus in Front-End development. Prior to studying at Turing I worked in health care and 
        in oil and energy. These busy environments taught me how to quickly adapt and communicate on different teams. Eventually 
        I realized that I would rather apply my intellect to the world of software development. This new trajectory has been 
        immensely rewarding and I look forward to broadening and sharpening my skill set in the future.
